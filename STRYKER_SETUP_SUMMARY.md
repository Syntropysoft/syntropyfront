# Stryker Configuration Summary

## ✅ Installation Completed

### Installed Dependencies
- `@stryker-mutator/core@8.7.1` - Stryker core
- `@stryker-mutator/jest-runner@8.7.1` - Jest runner

### Node.js Version
- Configured to use Node.js 18.20.3 (compatible with Stryker 8.x)
- Configuration command: `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use 18`

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `stryker.conf.json` - Main Stryker configuration
2. `MUTATION_TESTING.md` - Complete usage documentation
3. `STRYKER_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files
1. `package.json` - Added mutation testing scripts
2. `.gitignore` - Added Stryker folders

## 🚀 Available Scripts

```bash
# Complete execution (30-60 seconds)
npm run test:mutation

# Quick execution for development (15-30 seconds)
npm run test:mutation:quick

# Watch mode for iterative development
npm run test:mutation:watch
```

## 📊 Initial Results

### Mutation Score: 9.83%
- **Killed**: 100 mutations (detected by tests)
- **Survived**: 23 mutations (not detected - need better tests)
- **No Coverage**: 894 mutations (code not covered)

### Analysis by File
- **core/**: Excellent coverage (100% in BreadcrumbManager, ErrorManager, Logger)
- **index.js**: 44.53% - Needs test improvements
- **utils/**: 0% - No tests (RobustSerializer)
- **interceptors/**: 0% - No tests

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. High Priority
- Write tests for `RobustSerializer.js` (229 mutations without coverage)
- Improve tests in `index.js` (23 mutations survived)

### 2. Medium Priority
- Write tests for `Interceptors.js` (174 mutations without coverage)
- Tests for `Agent.js`, `BreadcrumbStore.js`, `ContextCollector.js`

### 3. Workflow Integration
- Add `npm run test:mutation:quick` to pre-commit
- Add `npm run test:mutation` to pre-release

## 🔧 Technical Configuration

### Configured Thresholds
- **High**: 70% (excellent)
- **Low**: 40% (acceptable)
- **Break**: null (doesn't fail the build)

### Mutated Files
- `src/**/*.js` (excludes tests)
- Excludes: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `coverage/`, `examples/`

### Reporters
- HTML: `reports/mutation/mutation.html`
- Clear Text: Console
- Progress: Progress bar

## 💡 Benefits Obtained

1. **Detection of Superficial Tests**: Stryker identifies code that is not well tested
2. **Quality Improvement**: Focus on functional tests vs. just coverage
3. **Iterative Development**: Watch mode for quick feedback
4. **Visual Reports**: Detailed HTML for analysis

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Stryker requires Node.js 18+ (automatically configured)
- Reports are generated in `reports/mutation/` (ignored by git)
- The initial low score (9.83%) is normal and expected
- Focus on "Survived" mutations to improve tests
